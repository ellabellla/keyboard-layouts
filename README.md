# Keyboard Layouts FORK

A fork of Chris Ricketts's Keyboard Layouts library. The fork removes all and strips down the library to it's core functions.

Get the keycodes and modifier keys required to type an ASCII string for a number of different keyboard layouts. 

Takes inspiration and the [initial layout mappings](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores/blob/master/teensy3/keylayouts.h) from the [Teensyduino project](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores).

It works by preprocessing a C header file that describes the key mappings for each layout, including any deadkeys using `#define`'s. It then uses [bindgen](https://docs.rs/bindgen/0.47.2/bindgen/) to convert those into Rust constants and then [syn](https://docs.rs/syn/0.15.26/syn/) to extract the relevant keycodes and masks. It finally uses [quote!](https://docs.rs/quote/0.6.11/quote/) and [lazystatic!](https://docs.rs/lazy_static/1.2.0/lazy_static/) to produce a layout map enabling you to switch keyboard layouts on the fly without recompilation. 

## Example Usage

```rust

let test_string = "This is a test string.\n";

// Get the sequence of HID packets that would be produced by a keyboard with the specified layout
let hid_packets = keyboard_layouts::string_to_hid_packets("LAYOUT_UNITED_KINGDOM", test_string).unwrap();

// Write those HID packets to your virtual keyboard device. In this case a OTG HID gadget device file (linux).
std::fs::write("/dev/hidg0", hid_packets);
```

### Virtual Keyboard Device

This depends on your operating system and underlying hardware. So far this has only been tried on Linux but the HID packets should be valid for Windows and Mac.

On Linux you can either:
- Create a HID gadget device file on a Linux SBC with an OTG USB port. E.g. Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone. [This guide describes how](https://www.isticktoit.net/?p=1383)
- Check out the tests to see how to use the [tokio-linux-uhid](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-linux-uhid) crate to create a virtual HID device on a Linux desktop

I'm afraid for Windows and Mac I have no idea.

## Testing 

Testing all the layouts are correct is hard. As a result the tests are hacky.

Testing for each layout is split into alphanumeric and symbols.
Each test:
1. Sets the user session's keyboard layout (only in plain virtual console, no X)
1. Creates a virtual HID device on the machine using /dev/uhid (user needs permissions)
1. Writes all the specified characters to the virtual HID device (cursor needs to be in the testing terminal and stay there)
1. Reads the string of types from stdin and compares with the original.
